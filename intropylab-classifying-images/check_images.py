# PROGRAMMER: Karl Krukow
# DATE CREATED: July 24
# REVISED DATE:             <=(Date Revised - if any)
# REVISED DATE: 05/14/2018 - added import statement that imports the print 
#                           functions that can be used to check the lab
# PURPOSE: Check images & report results: read them in, predict their
#          content (classifier), compare prediction to actual value labels
#          and output results
#
# Use argparse Expected Call with <> indicating expected user input:
#      python check_images.py --dir <directory with images> --arch <model>
#             --dogfile <file that contains dognames>
#   Example call:
#    python check_images.py --dir pet_images/ --arch vgg --dogfile dognames.txt
##
# Program Outline
# Repeat below for all three image classification algorithms (e.g. input algorithm as command line argument):
#
# Time your program
# Use Time Module to compute program runtime
# Get program Inputs from the user
# Use command line arguments to get user inputs
# Create Pet Images Labels
# Use the pet images filenames to create labels
# Store the pet image labels in a data structure (e.g. dictionary)
# Create Classifier Labels and Compare Labels
# Use the Classifier function classify the images and create the classifier labels
# Compare Classifier Labels to Pet Image Labels
# Store Pet Labels, Classifier Labels, and their comparison in a complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
# Classifying Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs"
# Classify all Labels (Pet & Classifier) as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs" using dognames.txt file
# Store new classifications in the complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
# Calculate the Results
# Use Labels and their classifications to determine how well the algorithm worked on classifying images.
# Print the Results
