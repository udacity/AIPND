    "From the lesson on linear combination, recall that the set of all possible vectors that you can reach with a linear combination of a given pair of vectors is called the span of those two vectors. Let's say we are given the pair of vectors $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{w}$, and we want to determine if a third vector $\\vec{t}$ is within their span. If vector $\\vec{t}$ is determined to be within their span, this means that $\\vec{t}$ can be written as a linear combination of the pair of vectors $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{w}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This could be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hspace{1cm}a\\vec{v} + b\\vec{w} = \\vec{t}$,$\\hspace{0.3cm}$where $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{w}$ are multiplied by scalars $a$ and $b$ and then added together to produce vector $\\vec{t}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hspace{1.2cm}$*Equation 1*\n",
    "\n",
    "This means if we can find a set of values for the scalars $a$ and $b$ that make *equation 1* true, then $\\vec{t}$ is within the span of $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{w}$. Otherwise, if there is **no** set of values of the scalars $a$ and $b$ that make *equation 1* true, then $\\vec{t}$ is **not** within their span. \n",
